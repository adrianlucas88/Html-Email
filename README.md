# Html-Email

This is an HTML email template. The document begins with a doctype declaration and defines the document as an XHTML 1.0 Transitional document. The <html> element is used to define the document's root element and includes a namespace attribute. The <head> section contains metadata, such as the document's character encoding, viewport size, and title. The "style" element contains CSS rules for the document's layout, which include padding and margin styles for the "p" and "button" elements.

The "body" section contains the main content of the email. A "table" element is used for layout purposes and includes various "tr" and "td" elements to organize the content. The email begins with a header section that includes a brief message. The next section introduces the content of the email and highlights new Volkswagen products.

There are two additional sections in the email that promote specific Volkswagen products, the T-Cross First Edition and the SUV range. These sections include images, headlines, and descriptions of the products. Finally, there is a call-to-action button to encourage readers to click a link and learn more about the products.
